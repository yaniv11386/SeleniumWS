## What is Selenium?

[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is a cross-platform software-testing framework for web applications.<br />
Selenium provides a recording & playback tool (*Selenium IDE*) for tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.<br />
It also provides the ability to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Java, Python, JavaScript and more <br />
Selenium automates browsers. **That's it!** What you do with that power is entirely up to you. <br />
Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors.<br />
Selenium can be deployed  on Windows, Linux, and OS X platforms and support automation on mobile platforms as well.

Selenium consist of 2 core features:

* Selenium IDE
* Selenium WebDriver

#### What is Selenium IDE?

Development environment for Selenium scripts.<br />
It is implemented as **a Firefox extension**, and allows you to record, edit, and debug tests.<br />
Selenium IDE includes the entire Selenium Core, allowing you to easily and quickly record and play back tests in the actual environment that they will run in.<br />
Selenium IDE is not only a recording tool: it is a complete IDE.<br /> 
You can choose to use its recording capability, or you may edit your scripts by hand.<br />

>**Optional:** Install Selenium IDE for Firefox browser <br />
Download it from [SeleniumHQ download page](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).

#### What is WebDriver?

A compact Object Oriented API to control web browsers behavior.<br />
Driving a browser natively **as a user would** either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium Server.<br />
Supported browsers: Chrome, IE, FF, Safari, Opera.<br />
Selenium-WebDriver makes direct calls to the browser using each browser s native support for automation.
